The series is densely packed with world-building, origin stories, and lore that has drawn in fans worldwide, some who are familiar with Riot’s games and many who are not. Co-creator Christian Linke confirmed earlier in 2024 that Arcane Season 2 would be the last for the series but that the team had many more ideas in development set in the League of Legends world.'

        question: 'Will there be any similar projects?',
        answer: 'Arcane is Riot Games’ first foray into the movie and TV space, with the animated series bringing to life the stories of some of League of Legends\' most iconic champions in a stunning visual style from animation studio Fortiche. The series is densely packed with world-building, origin stories, and lore that has drawn in fans worldwide, some who are familiar with Riot’s games and many who are not. Co-creator Christian Linke confirmed earlier in 2024 that Arcane Season 2 would be the last for the series but that the team had many more ideas in development set in the League of Legends world.'
